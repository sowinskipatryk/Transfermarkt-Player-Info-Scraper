This scraper uses Selenium to get data from multiple pages by opening and closing the browser, which makes it incredibly slow. 
It's not the best solution but at least it works. 
The data is saved to .csv file temporarily and then exported to .xlsx when it finishes to hoard the data from the site. 
The result excel file can be downloaded from this repository so you don't need to flood the site with requests unless it's necessary.
Obviously there are many reasons why you should use API services instead of scraping the data directly from a page.
Check the Terms of Service of the site before using the scraper.
